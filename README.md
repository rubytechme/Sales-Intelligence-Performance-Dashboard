### Analysis:

## Total Revenue

Revenue in 2023 declined by 6.9% compared to 2022, totaling $6.96 million, down from $7.48 million the previous year. However, this decrease is largely attributable to the absence of recorded data for the second quarter (September to December), which likely impacted the overall revenue figures.

## Total Profit

The company's profit followed a similar trend to revenue, declining in 2023 to $1.82 million, compared to $2.19 million in 2022. Again, this decrease may be as a result of the absence of recorded data for the second quarter (September to December), which likely impacted the overall revenue figures.

## Total Cost

Total costs in 2023 showed a slight decline, falling to $5.12 million from $5.29 million in 2022. However, overall costs reflects two key observations:
High Operating Costs: Despite generating $7.8 million in revenue in 2022, the company incurred $5.29 million in costs, indicating a low profit margin and other  potential profitability concerns.

There is also an Incomplete 2023 Data and the reported decline in 2023 costs is likely understated, as figures for Q4 (September to December) are yet to be updated. Once included, total costs for the year may align more closely with previous levels.

## Total Quantity

As of Q3 2023, 541,000 units have been sold—just slightly below the 549,000 units sold in all of 2022. While the full-year figure for 2023 is expected to surpass 2022 once Q4 data is included, current performance raises some important concerns:

1. In 2022, 549,000 units generated $7.4 million in revenue, implying an average unit price of $13.
2. In 2023, 541,000 units have so far brought in $6.9 million, suggesting that if the $13 price point remained consistent, revenue should have already exceeded 2022’s performance.

This discrepancy suggests two possibilities:

- 2023 is underperforming, even with near-identical sales volume.
- Or, the price per unit has decreased in 2023, which would explain the lower revenue despite high volume.

## Yearly Revenue

Revenue trends indicate a consistent spike between the end of Q1 and throughout Q2 across both 2022 and 2023, highlighting this period as a strong contributor to annual performance.
Notably, December 2022 recorded exceptionally high revenue, which may be attributed to increased tourism activity and heightened consumer spending during the holiday season. However, for 2023, revenue data for the September to December period is still pending, making it difficult to confirm whether this seasonal trend is recurring or was a one-time occurrence.
A complete picture will emerge once Q4 data for 2023 is finalized, allowing for a more accurate comparison and validation of this hypothesis.

## Revenue by Location 

Downtown consistently generated the highest share of total revenue in both 2022 and 2023—55% and 56%, respectively. This was followed by the Commercial, Residential, and Airport zones in descending order.
This trend suggests that Downtown remains the core driver of business activity, likely due to its concentration of foot traffic, tourist engagement, and commercial hubs. The slight year-over-year increase also indicates that Downtown's dominance is not only stable but potentially growing.
This insight highlights the importance of prioritizing operations, marketing, and resource allocation in the Downtown area to maximize returns. Further analysis could explore what factors are contributing to Downtown's performance, and whether similar strategies can be replicated in underperforming zones like Residential or Airport.

## Profit by Quarter 

Although profit data for Q4 2023 is currently unavailable, one consistent trend across both years is that Q2 recorded some of the highest profit levels.
Notably, in Q4 2022, the company achieved its highest revenue of the year, driven likely by increased seasonal demand. While the absence of Q4 2023 data limits direct comparison, early indicators suggest that Q2 and Q4 are historically the strongest-performing quarters in terms of both profit and revenue.
This insight points to seasonal patterns worth monitoring, and emphasizes the importance of strategic planning around Q2 and Q4 to maximize performance.


## Revenue and Profit by Product Category

Toys generated the highest overall revenue and profit among all product categories. However, its profit margin is significantly lower compared to Arts & Crafts and Electronics.

To illustrate:
1. Toys brought in over $5 million in revenue, but retained only $1 million in profit.
2. In contrast, Arts & Crafts and Electronics each generated just over $2 million in revenue, yet retained $700k and $1 million in profit respectively.

This indicates that Toys is a high-volume, low-margin category, while Arts & Crafts and Electronics are more efficient in converting revenue into profit. The disparity in margins highlights an opportunity to optimize pricing, cost structure, or bundling strategies within the Toy category to improve profitability.

## Detailed store figures

Maven Toys Ciudad de México 2 recorded the highest figures across all key performance metrics, with:

- Revenue: $554K
- Profit: $169K
- Quantity Sold: 42K units

Similarly, Maven Toys Ciudad de México 1 also performed strongly across the board.

In summary, it's clear that the Maven Toys Ciudad de México locations are top-performing stores, demonstrating consistently strong sales, profitability, and customer volume. This makes them valuable benchmarks for assessing store-level performance and identifying strategies that can be replicated across other locations.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:

## Conclusion
The overall business performance between 2022 and 2023 shows signs of both consistency and areas of concern. While revenue only declined by 6.9%, this figure may not fully reflect actual performance due to missing Q4 2023 data. Historically strong quarters like Q2 and Q4 continue to drive the majority of revenue and profit, with Q4 2022 being particularly outstanding likely due to increased tourism and seasonal demand.
Profit margins remain thin, particularly within the Toys category, which, although high in volume and revenue, underperforms in profitability compared to smaller categories like Arts & Crafts and Electronics. Additionally, the average unit price appears to have dropped in 2023, impacting revenue despite a nearly equivalent quantity sold to 2022.
In terms of geographic performance, the Downtown zone consistently leads all others, accounting for over half of total revenue. At the store level, Maven Toys Ciudad de México (both branches) emerged as top performers, leading in revenue, profit, and quantity sold.

## Key Recommendations

1. Investigate Pricing Strategy
- Conduct a detailed unit price analysis to determine whether 2023's average price decreased and assess if it's aligned with market expectations and cost structure.
- Consider re-evaluating pricing tiers, especially for low-margin products like Toys.

2. Optimize High-Volume, Low-Margin Categories
- Review cost drivers in the Toys category to improve margins through better sourcing, bundling, or reducing discount dependency.
- Explore cross-selling or upselling with higher-margin categories like Electronics or Arts & Crafts.
  
3. Leverage Seasonal Trends
- Reinforce sales and marketing campaigns during Q2 and Q4, which historically yield the strongest performance.
- Plan early for holiday campaigns, especially in locations like Downtown and Ciudad de México where revenue spikes are notable.

4. Prioritize High-Performing Stores
- Use Maven Toys Ciudad de México 1 & 2 as models for operational excellence, staffing, and inventory management.
- Identify key drivers of their success and apply those learnings to underperforming branches.
  
5. Address Data Gaps
- Ensure timely and complete reporting, especially for critical periods like Q4, to allow for more accurate year-over-year comparisons.
- Improve systems for real-time data collection and analytics.

6. Strengthen Profitability Monitoring
- Shift focus from just top-line revenue to unit economics and margin per product line.
- Track profit per unit sold, not just overall profit, to better identify which products and locations are truly performing.
